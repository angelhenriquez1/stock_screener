# stock_screener

This code allows us to easily collect EPS, PE, Price Targets, and Analyst recommendations from websites such as Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, finviz, Zacks Investment Research, and CNN Money.

Currently, simply insert a stock symbol in quotes (ex: "GOOG") and the code will do the rest. The single stock function (stock_data_func) is working; however, the multi-stock function is still being worked on.

This code is not to be sold and if replicated, changed, and/or used by you or someone you know, please reference me by name and github account, Angel Henriquez and @angelhenriquez1, respectively.

Thanks and enjoy!
