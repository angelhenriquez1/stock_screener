# Stock Screener by Angel Henriquez

This code allows us to easily collect EPS, PE, Price Targets, and Analyst recommendations from websites such as Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, finviz, Zacks Investment Research, and CNN Money.

Simply insert a stock symbol in quotes (ex: "GOOG") into the stock_data_func() function and the code will do the rest. The single stock function works; however, the multi-stock function is still being worked on.

For a faster overview, apply the stock symbol to the analyst_rec() function and you will be provided a quick overview of the analyst recommendations from several of the aforementioned websites.

This code is not to be sold and if replicated, changed, and/or used, please reference me by name and github account, Angel Henriquez and @angelhenriquez1, respectively.

If you have any recommendations on how to make my code more efficient or grow this idea, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelhenriquez1/).

Thanks and enjoy!
